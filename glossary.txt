"raw diff"
  the return value from a differ or plugin's #diff method
  this can be anything, from an array of arrays (hashdiff) to a string with a
  git diff inside

diff
  the return value from the Specdiff::diff method.
  this is not the direct return value from a plugin/differ, that is the
  "raw diff" (or diff.raw)

differ
  a class responding to ::diff(a, b) and ::stringify(diff) able to produce a
  human-comprehensible diff output for your terminal

plugin
  external differ (has to respond to more methods)
  may be provided from outside the gem (for example by a user drowning in xml)

"built in differ"
  differ living in the specdiff/differ directory

"built in plugin"
  plugin shipped with the gem, but needs to be loaded using Specdiff.load!

type
  a symbol like :text, :json or :hash which denotes the type of data in a way
  which is useful for picking a differ

  a plugin returns a type from its #id method

  :text
    a string which likely contains plaintext data of some kind

"plugin type"
  a type added by loading a plugin (not built into specdiff)

side
  an object containing a value and a type

  used to represent the two sides to a comparison

  when defining a plugin, you receive two sides: a and b, to various methods

compare
  the procedure that implements the main function of specdiff including
  accounting for any plugin types and differs

integration
  refers to the provided monkey-patches and conscious relationship between
  specdiff and another gem or piece of software it was intended to work with.
