type
  a symbol like :text, :json or :hash which denotes the type of data in a way
  which is useful for picking a differ

  :text
    a string which likely contains plaintext data of some kind

side
  an object containing either side of a comparison that needs to be made
  when defining a plugin, the diff method receives two sides: a, b
  most importantly, a side contains a value and a type
